### JavaScript Basics

1. **What is JavaScript? How does it differ from Java?**
   - **JavaScript** is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for creating dynamic and interactive content on websites. It follows the ECMAScript standard and can be used both on the client-side and server-side (with Node.js). 
   - **Differences from Java**:
     - **Syntax**: While both have similar syntax, JavaScript is prototype-based and dynamic, whereas Java is class-based and static.
     - **Execution Environment**: JavaScript runs in the browser and on servers via Node.js, while Java runs in a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
     - **Concurrency Model**: JavaScript uses a single-threaded, event-driven model with an event loop, whereas Java uses a multi-threaded model with concurrency control.

2. **Explain the difference between "null" and "undefined" in JavaScript.**
   - **`null`**: Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is an assignment value, meaning a variable can be set to `null`.
   - **`undefined`**: Indicates that a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.

3. **What is the purpose of the "strict mode" in JavaScript?**
   - **Strict mode** is a way to opt into a restricted variant of JavaScript, introduced in ECMAScript 5. It helps catch common coding errors, prevents the use of some features that are considered problematic, and improves the performance of the code by enabling optimizations. It can be enabled by adding `"use strict";` at the beginning of a script or function.

4. **Describe the event loop and how it enables asynchronous behavior in JavaScript.**
   - The **event loop** is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations despite being single-threaded. It works by handling the execution of code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. The event loop continuously checks the message queue and executes tasks as they arrive, enabling asynchronous behavior.

5. **What are the differences between "let", "const", and "var" for variable declaration?**
   - **`var`**: Function-scoped or globally-scoped, can be re-declared and updated, and hoisted to the top of its scope.
   - **`let`**: Block-scoped, cannot be re-declared in the same scope, can be updated, and is not hoisted to the top of its block scope.
   - **`const`**: Block-scoped, cannot be re-declared or updated, requires an initializer, and is not hoisted to the top of its block scope.

### Data Types and Variables

6. **List and explain the primitive data types in JavaScript.**
   - **String**: Represents textual data (`"hello"`).
   - **Number**: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers (`42`, `3.14`).
   - **Boolean**: Represents true or false values (`true`, `false`).
   - **Undefined**: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
   - **Null**: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
   - **Symbol**: Represents a unique identifier (introduced in ES6).
   - **BigInt**: Represents whole numbers larger than `2^53 - 1` (introduced in ES2020).

7. **What is type coercion in JavaScript? Provide an example.**
   - **Type coercion** is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another. For example:
     ```javascript
     console.log('5' - 3); // Outputs 2 (string '5' is coerced to number 5)
     console.log('5' + 3); // Outputs '53' (number 3 is coerced to string '3')
     ```

8. **Explain the concept of "hoisting" in JavaScript.**
   - **Hoisting** is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This means that variables declared with `var` and function declarations can be used before they are defined in the code.

9. **How would you clone an object in JavaScript?**
   - You can clone an object using the spread operator, `Object.assign()`, or structured cloning:
     ```javascript
     // Using the spread operator
     const original = { a: 1, b: 2 };
     const clone = { ...original };

     // Using Object.assign()
     const clone = Object.assign({}, original);

     // Using structured cloning (deep clone)
     const clone = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(original));
     ```

### Functions

10. **What is a closure in JavaScript? Provide an example.**
    - A **closure** is a function that remembers the environment in which it was created, even after that environment has gone. This allows the function to access variables from its containing scope.
      ```javascript
      function makeCounter() {
          let count = 0;
          return function() {
              count++;
              return count;
          };
      }
      const counter = makeCounter();
      console.log(counter()); // 1
      console.log(counter()); // 2
      ```

11. **Explain the concept of "function scope" and "block scope".**
    - **Function scope**: Variables declared within a function are accessible only within that function.
    - **Block scope**: Variables declared within a block (e.g., within curly braces `{}`) are accessible only within that block. This is achieved using `let` and `const`.

12. **Describe the differences between function declarations and function expressions.**
    - **Function Declaration**: A named function defined using the `function` keyword.
      ```javascript
      function myFunction() {
          // code
      }
      ```
    - **Function Expression**: A function that can be anonymous or named, defined within an expression.
      ```javascript
      const myFunction = function() {
          // code
      };
      ```

13. **What is a higher-order function? Provide an example.**
    - A **higher-order function** is a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function as a result.
      ```javascript
      function greet(name) {
          return function(message) {
              console.log(`Hello ${name}, ${message}`);
          };
      }
      const greetJohn = greet('John');
      greetJohn('Good morning!'); // Hello John, Good morning!
      ```

14. **Explain the "this" keyword in JavaScript.**
    - The **`this`** keyword refers to the object from which the function is called. Its value is determined by how a function is called:
      - In a method: refers to the owner object.
      - Alone: refers to the global object (in strict mode, `undefined`).
      - In an event: refers to the element that received the event.
      - In a constructor: refers to the newly created object.

### Arrays and Objects

15. **How would you iterate over an array in JavaScript?**
    - You can iterate over an array using various methods:
      ```javascript
      const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

      // Using for loop
      for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
          console.log(arr[i]);
      }

      // Using forEach
      arr.forEach(item => console.log(item));

      // Using for...of
      for (const item of arr) {
          console.log(item);
      }

      // Using map
      arr.map(item => console.log(item));
      ```

16. **Explain the difference between "map", "forEach", "filter", and "reduce" functions.**
    - **`map`**: Creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element.
    - **`forEach`**: Executes a provided function once for each array element.
    - **`filter`**: Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
    - **`reduce`**: Executes a reducer function on each element, resulting in a single output value.

17. **How do you add and remove properties from an object in JavaScript?**
    - **Add Property**:
      ```javascript
      const obj = { a: 1 };
      obj.b = 2;
      obj['c'] = 3;
      ```
    - **Remove Property**:
      ```javascript
      delete obj.b;
      ```

18. **Describe the purpose of the "spread operator" and provide an example.**
    - The **spread operator** (`...`) allows an iterable (e.g., array, string) to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments or elements are expected.
      ```javascript
      // In arrays
      const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
      const arr2 = [...arr1, 4, 5];

      // In objects
      const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
      const obj2 = { ...obj1, c: 3 };
      ```

19. **What is object destructuring and how does it work?**
    - **Object destructuring** is a syntax for extracting values from objects and arrays and assigning them to variables.
      ```javascript
      const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
      const { name, age } = person;
      ```

### Asynchronous Programming

20. **What are Promises in JavaScript? How do they help in managing asynchronous operations?**
    - **Promises** are

 objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. They allow chaining of asynchronous operations and handling of success or failure cases in a clean and readable way.
      ```javascript
      const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          setTimeout(() => resolve('Success!'), 1000);
      });

      promise.then(result => console.log(result)).catch(error => console.error(error));
      ```

21. **Describe the async/await syntax. How does it improve asynchronous code readability?**
    - The **async/await** syntax provides a way to work with asynchronous code in a synchronous-like manner, making it easier to read and maintain. `async` functions implicitly return a promise, and `await` pauses the function execution until the promise is resolved or rejected.
      ```javascript
      async function fetchData() {
          try {
              const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
              const data = await response.json();
              console.log(data);
          } catch (error) {
              console.error('Error:', error);
          }
      }
      ```

22. **Explain the concept of callbacks and callback hell in asynchronous programming.**
    - **Callbacks** are functions passed as arguments to other functions and executed after some operation has been completed.
    - **Callback hell** refers to the situation where multiple nested callbacks make code difficult to read and maintain. It can be avoided using promises and async/await.

23. **How does the "fetch" API work for making HTTP requests in JavaScript?**
    - The **fetch** API provides a way to make network requests and handle responses. It returns a promise that resolves to the response.
      ```javascript
      fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
          .then(response => response.json())
          .then(data => console.log(data))
          .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
      ```

24. **What is the purpose of the "try...catch" statement in handling errors?**
    - The **try...catch** statement allows you to catch and handle errors that occur during the execution of code. The code inside the `try` block is executed, and if an error occurs, the control is transferred to the `catch` block where the error can be handled.

### ES6 Features

25. **Explain the purpose of arrow functions in JavaScript.**
    - **Arrow functions** provide a shorter syntax for writing function expressions. They do not have their own `this` context, making them useful in cases where you want to preserve the `this` value from the surrounding lexical context.
      ```javascript
      const add = (a, b) => a + b;
      ```

26. **What are template literals? How do they differ from regular strings?**
    - **Template literals** are string literals allowing embedded expressions. They are enclosed by backticks (`` ` ``) instead of quotes and can contain placeholders indicated by `${}`.
      ```javascript
      const name = 'John';
      const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
      ```

27. **Describe the "class" syntax in ES6 for creating object-oriented structures.**
    - The **class** syntax provides a way to define classes and create objects in an object-oriented manner. It includes support for constructors, methods, inheritance, and static methods.
      ```javascript
      class Person {
          constructor(name, age) {
              this.name = name;
              this.age = age;
          }

          greet() {
              console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
          }
      }

      const john = new Person('John', 30);
      john.greet(); // Hello, my name is John
      ```

28. **What is a "generator" function? How is it different from a regular function?**
    - A **generator** function is a special type of function that can pause its execution and resume later. It is defined using the `function*` syntax and uses the `yield` keyword to pause execution.
      ```javascript
      function* generator() {
          yield 1;
          yield 2;
          yield 3;
      }

      const gen = generator();
      console.log(gen.next().value); // 1
      console.log(gen.next().value); // 2
      console.log(gen.next().value); // 3
      ```

29. **Explain the concept of modules in ES6 JavaScript.**
    - **Modules** allow you to break your code into separate files and import/export functionality as needed. This helps in organizing code and managing dependencies.
      ```javascript
      // module.js
      export const add = (a, b) => a + b;

      // main.js
      import { add } from './module.js';
      console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
      ```

### Scope and Closures

30. **Describe the differences between global scope, function scope, and block scope.**
    - **Global scope**: Variables declared outside any function or block are accessible from anywhere in the code.
    - **Function scope**: Variables declared within a function are accessible only within that function.
    - **Block scope**: Variables declared within a block (e.g., using `let` or `const`) are accessible only within that block.

31. **What is the "lexical scope" in JavaScript?**
    - **Lexical scope** refers to the scope defined by the physical placement of the code. Inner functions have access to the variables of their outer functions, forming a scope chain.

32. **How does closure work in JavaScript? Provide an example.**
    - A **closure** is created when a function is defined inside another function and accesses variables from its parent scope.
      ```javascript
      function outer() {
          let outerVar = 'I am outside!';

          function inner() {
              console.log(outerVar);
          }

          return inner;
      }

      const innerFunc = outer();
      innerFunc(); // I am outside!
      ```

33. **Explain the "IIFE" (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) pattern.**
    - An **IIFE** is a function that is executed immediately after it is defined. It is useful for creating a new scope to avoid polluting the global scope.
      ```javascript
      (function() {
          console.log('IIFE executed!');
      })();
      ```

### Prototypes and Inheritance

34. **What is prototypal inheritance in JavaScript?**
    - **Prototypal inheritance** is a feature in JavaScript where objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects. This is achieved through the prototype chain.

35. **Explain the relationship between prototypes and constructor functions.**
    - **Constructor functions** create objects and set their `prototype` property to the `prototype` property of the constructor function. This allows all instances created by the constructor to inherit from the same prototype.

36. **How would you create an object that inherits from another object in JavaScript?**
    - You can create an object that inherits from another object using `Object.create()`.
      ```javascript
      const parent = { a: 1 };
      const child = Object.create(parent);
      console.log(child.a); // 1
      ```

37. **Describe the difference between "classical inheritance" and "prototypal inheritance".**
    - **Classical inheritance** involves creating a hierarchy of classes, where child classes inherit from parent classes. It is typical in languages like Java and C++.
    - **Prototypal inheritance** involves creating objects that inherit directly from other objects. It is more flexible and used in JavaScript.

### Event Handling

38. **How do you attach event listeners to DOM elements in JavaScript?**
    - You can attach event listeners using `addEventListener`.
      ```javascript
      const button = document.querySelector('button');
      button.addEventListener('click', () => {
          console.log('Button clicked!');
      });
      ```

39. **Explain event delegation and its advantages.**
    - **Event delegation** involves using a single event listener to manage events for multiple child elements. It takes advantage of event bubbling and improves performance by reducing the number of event listeners.
      ```javascript
      document.querySelector('#parent').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
          if (event.target.matches('.child')) {
              console.log('Child element clicked!');
          }
      });
      ```

40. **What is the event object in JavaScript? How can you access properties from it?**
    - The **event object** is automatically passed to event handler functions and contains information about the event. You can access its properties to get details about the event.
      ```javascript
      button.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
          console.log(event.type); // click
          console.log(event.target); // button element
      });
      ```

### Error Handling and Debugging

41. **Describe different ways to handle errors in JavaScript code.**
    - **try...catch**: To handle synchronous errors.
      ```javascript
      try {
          // code
      } catch (error) {
          console.error(error);
      }
      ```
    - **Promises**: Using `.catch()` to handle asynchronous errors.
    - **Async/Await**: Using `try...catch` with async functions.
    - **Event listeners**: Handling errors in event-driven code.

42. **How do you use the "console" object for debugging JavaScript applications?**
    - The **console** object provides various methods for debugging:
      ```javascript
      console.log('Log message');
      console.error('Error message');
      console.warn('Warning message');
      console.dir(object);
      console.table(array);
      console.time('timer');
      console.timeEnd('timer');
      ```

43. **What are Java

Script source maps and how do they assist in debugging?**
    - **Source maps** map the compiled code back to the original source code, enabling easier debugging by allowing you to see the original code in the browser's developer tools.

44. **Explain the concept of stack traces and how they aid in identifying errors.**
    - A **stack trace** is a report of the active stack frames at a certain point in time during the execution of a program. It helps identify where an error occurred by showing the sequence of function calls leading to the error.

### DOM Manipulation

45. **What is the Document Object Model (DOM) in relation to web development?**
    - The **DOM** is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of nodes, allowing scripts to update the content, structure, and style of a document.

46. **How do you create, modify, and delete DOM elements using JavaScript?**
    - **Create**:
      ```javascript
      const newElement = document.createElement('div');
      newElement.textContent = 'Hello, world!';
      document.body.appendChild(newElement);
      ```
    - **Modify**:
      ```javascript
      newElement.textContent = 'Hello, JavaScript!';
      ```
    - **Delete**:
      ```javascript
      newElement.remove();
      ```

47. **Explain the difference between the "innerHTML" and "textContent" properties.**
    - **`innerHTML`**: Sets or gets the HTML content of an element, including HTML tags.
    - **`textContent`**: Sets or gets the text content of an element, ignoring HTML tags.

48. **Describe how you would traverse and manipulate the DOM tree in JavaScript.**
    - You can traverse the DOM tree using various properties and methods:
      ```javascript
      const parent = document.getElementById('parent');
      const children = parent.children;
      const firstChild = parent.firstElementChild;
      const lastChild = parent.lastElementChild;
      const nextSibling = parent.nextElementSibling;
      const prevSibling = parent.previousElementSibling;
      ```

### Browser APIs

49. **What are Web APIs in the context of JavaScript? Provide examples.**
    - **Web APIs** are interfaces provided by the browser to interact with the web page and server. Examples include:
      - **DOM API**: Manipulate HTML and CSS.
      - **Fetch API**: Make network requests.
      - **Storage API**: Store data locally.
      - **Geolocation API**: Get the user's location.

50. **How do you work with local storage and session storage using JavaScript?**
    - **Local Storage**: Stores data with no expiration date.
      ```javascript
      localStorage.setItem('key', 'value');
      const value = localStorage.getItem('key');
      localStorage.removeItem('key');
      localStorage.clear();
      ```
    - **Session Storage**: Stores data for the duration of the page session.
      ```javascript
      sessionStorage.setItem('key', 'value');
      const value = sessionStorage.getItem('key');
      sessionStorage.removeItem('key');
      sessionStorage.clear();
      ```
